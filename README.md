# PostFacto-UI

1. Run the elm-package install to download all dependencies
2. Ensure you do an elm-make Postfacto.elm --output=postfacto.js

The project is WIP. It will be cleaned up further, integrated with backend in stages :)

Currently developing in small phases. 

To quickly check, just run the index.html. 
Please note that the postfacto.js may not be the latest and greatest as I might forget to generate a new one. 
So in case you want to ensure the latest and greatest, generate it as mentioned above.
